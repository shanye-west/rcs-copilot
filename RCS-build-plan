Rowdy Cup App: Strategic Build Plan
Build Order Overview
For a complex PWA like yours with offline support and real-time updates, we'll follow a foundation-first approach. This means building core infrastructure before user-facing features, ensuring we don't have to refactor critical parts later.
Here's the recommended build sequence:
Phase 1: Database & Authentication Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. Database Schema Setup
Create complete Supabase schema first (all tables, relationships)
Set up Row-Level Security policies for auth
Add initial seed data (match types, sample tournament)
Test queries for critical data relationships
2. Authentication System
Implement username/PIN login interface
Set up protected routes with redirects
Create user management for admins
Test auth flow completely
3. Base Layout & Navigation
Create app shell with responsive layout
Implement hamburger menu and navigation
Set up route structure in SvelteKit
Build loading states and error boundaries
Phase 2: Tournament & Match Core (Weeks 3-4)
1. Tournament Structure
Create tournament home page (list of tournaments)
Build round listing page (matches in a round)
Implement admin controls for tournament/round creation
Add locking mechanism for rounds
2. Match Components (One at a time)
Start with simplest match type (1v1 Individual)
Then build 2v2 Team Scramble (gross scoring)
Add Best Ball component with handicap calculations
Finally implement the remaining match types
3. Scoring Logic
Implement gross scoring system first
Build handicap calculation logic
Create net scoring mechanism
Add match status calculation (AS, 1â†‘, etc.)
Phase 3: Offline & Realtime (Weeks 5-6)
1. Offline Support
Set up service worker registration
Create IndexedDB storage for offline data
Implement sync queue mechanism
Add visual indicators for sync status
2. Real-time Updates
Configure Supabase realtime channels
Set up subscription management
Add client-side state updates on data changes
Test concurrent scoring scenarios
Phase 4: Sportsbook Module (Weeks 7-8)
1. Public Sportsbook View
Create bet listing interface
Implement filter controls
Build money leaderboard
2. Betting Management
Create My Bets page with sections
Implement bet creation workflow
Add accept/decline/counter functionality
Set up notification system
3. Bet Resolution
Implement auto-resolution logic
Create manual resolution interface
Add payment tracking system
Phase 5: Stats & Polish (Weeks 9-10)
1. Player Statistics
Build profile page base
Implement stats calculation logic
Create head-to-head comparison view
Add historical data displays
2. Final Polish
Implement comprehensive error handling
Add animations and transitions
Optimize loading performance
Conduct usability testing
Component-by-Component Build Strategy
When building each feature, I recommend this mini-cycle:
Start with the database model for the feature
Create the SvelteKit endpoint (API route)
Build the component with mock data initially
Connect to live data and test
Add error states and edge cases
Implement offline support for the feature
Specific Component Development Order
I recommend building these key components in this sequence:
Tournament Home (foundational navigation hub)
Individual Match Scorecard (simplest scoring logic)
Team Scramble Scorecard (gross scoring)
Best Ball Scorecard (most complex with handicaps)
Sportsbook Listing (public view)
My Bets Management (personal interface)
Player Profile (builds on existing data)
For Working with AI
When you're ready to build a specific component, tell the AI:
What component you're building (from the list above)
The exact requirements for that component
Which related components are already built
Where you're currently stuck (if applicable)
For example: "Let's build the 2-man Best Ball scorecard component. This match type requires individual player scores, displaying handicap dots on applicable holes, calculating net scores, and automatically using the better net score for each team. We've already built the basic tournament and round views."
This structured approach to building your app will ensure a strong foundation, minimize rework, and create a clean, maintainable codebase that AI can help you develop efficiently.
