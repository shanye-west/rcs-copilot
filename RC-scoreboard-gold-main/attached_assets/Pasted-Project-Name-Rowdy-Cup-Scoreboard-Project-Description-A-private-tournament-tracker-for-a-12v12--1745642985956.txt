Example Applications
â†’ Not specified yet.
If you'd like, I can suggest apps similar to tournament trackers or fantasy sports apps for inspiration!

Would you like extras like push notifications ("Match update!"), MVP stats, team colors, or a way to input live commentary?

To finish the full prompt for you, can you help me quickly fill in the missing pieces:

Once you answer these, I'll wrap it up into a super clean final prompt you can hand to Replit Agent! ðŸš€

Would you like me to suggest a few hosting options and interface styles too while you think? ðŸŽ¯

don't need offline support. i have my own website domain that it can probably be hosted on. our website is www.rowdycup.com -- so i want the interface style to somewhat match that. i want it to be similar in function to Golf Genius. I want a home page that has the total tournament score. it should have a list of the 4 rounds below that. each tile should have the type of match it is (2-man Team Scramble, 2-man Team Shamble, 2-man Team Best Ball, 4-man Team Shamble). and the scores for that round. clicking on the round tile should take you to that round's main page. the main page will have the round's total scores at the top. under than will be the tiles for each individual match. each match tile should have the players in the match and the live score of the match. clicking on the match tile should bring to that match's scorecard. the scorecard should have all 18 holes in a typical golf scorecard format. players can update the scorecard and have it update the scores in real time. all events/rounds are match play
